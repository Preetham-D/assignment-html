      <h2>Triathlon</h2>
      <!-- hero element -->
      <p>
        A triathlon is a multiple-stage competition involving the completion of three continuous and sequential endurance disciplines.
        While many variations of the sport exist, triathlon, in its most popular form, involves swimming, cycling, and running
        in immediate succession over various distances. Triathletes compete for fastest overall course completion time, including
        timed "transitions" between the individual swim, cycle, and run components.The word "triathlon" is of Greek origin
        from competition.
      </p>
      <p id="hero_para">
        A transition area is set up where the athletes change gear for different segments of the race. This is where the switches
        from swimming to cycling and cycling to running occur. These areas are used to store bicycles, performance apparel,
        and any other accessories needed for the next stage of the race. The transition from swim to bike is referred to
        as T1 and that between the bike and run is referred to as T2. The athlete's overall time for the race includes time
        spent in T1 and T2.Transition areas vary in size depending on the number of participants expected. In addition, these
        areas provide a social headquarters before the race.

        <h2>Swimming</h2>
        <p>
          Triathlon swimming is different from competitive swimming. Although the goals are the same--complete the distance as fast
          as possible--triathlon requires you to be as efficient as you can in order save energy for the bike and run later
          on. In fact, many triathletes feel that the race does not really start until they get on the bike, and they think
          of the swim as a warm-up for the hard parts still to come.

        <h2>Running</h2>
        <p>
          Running after riding a bike is different from running on fresh legs. Prior activity makes you feel heavy-legged and uncoordinated
          when you start running. Nobody runs as fast after a hard bike ride as he or she does in a standalone run. But some
          triathletes lose less running performance off the bike than others. For this reason, the best runners are not always
          the best triathlon runners.

        <h2>Cycling</h2>
        <p>
          Triathlon bike training is also different to training for cyclists. Not only do you want to get faster on the bike, but you
          also want to minimize the effect of cycling on your running. We are always amazed at how much difference the right
          bike training makes to peoples running performances. Many a runner has taken to triathlon and found they underperform
          on the run, because the bike has fatigued them too much.

          Bill Black was a lecturer in PE, Sport and Recreation when he heard about this sport called triathlon. In a very short period
          of time he became a coach and started working with Spencer Smith. This started a long career as one of the worlds
          leading triathlon coaches.
