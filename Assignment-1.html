      <h2>Triathlon</h2>
      <p>
        A triathlon is a multiple-stage competition involving the completion of three continuous and sequential endurance disciplines.[1] While many variations of the sport exist, triathlon, in its most popular form, involves swimming, cycling, and running in immediate succession over various distances. Triathletes compete for fastest overall course completion time, including timed "transitions" between the individual swim, cycle, and run components.[1] The word "triathlon" is of Greek origin from τρεῖς or treis ("three") and ἆθλος or athlos ("competition").[2]

          A transition area is set up where the athletes change gear for different segments of the race. This is where the switches from swimming to cycling and cycling to running occur. These areas are used to store bicycles, performance apparel, and any other accessories needed for the next stage of the race. The transition from swim to bike is referred to as T1 and that between the bike and run is referred to as T2. The athlete's overall time for the race includes time spent in T1 and T2.[3] Transition areas vary in size depending on the number of participants expected. In addition, these areas provide a social headquarters before the race.

        <h2>Swimming</h2>
        <p>
            Triathlon swimming is different from competitive swimming. Although the goals are the same--complete the distance as fast as possible--triathlon requires you to be as efficient as you can in order save energy for the bike and run later on. In fact, many triathletes feel that the race does not really start until they get on the bike, and they think of the swim as a warm-up for the hard parts still to come.

        <h2>Running</h2>
        <p>
           Running after riding a bike is different from running on fresh legs. Prior activity makes you feel heavy-legged and uncoordinated when you start running. Nobody runs as fast after a hard bike ride as he or she does in a standalone run. But some triathletes lose less running performance off the bike than others. For this reason, the best runners are not always the best triathlon runners.

        <h2>Cycling</h2>
        <p>
          Triathlon bike training is also different to training for cyclists. Not only do you want to get faster on the bike, but you also want to minimize the effect of cycling on your running.
          We are always amazed at how much difference the right bike training makes to peoples running performances. Many a runner has taken to triathlon and found they underperform on the run, because the bike has fatigued them too much.
